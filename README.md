# Hydra-self-testing

START WITH THE FILE sim_code.R to read the GB real data (hydraDataList), read the outputs from the initial run or OM, create the simulated data sets with the OM and save the ts.dat files, then run the model nsim times and save the .rep and .par files for each simulation. 

Folder R: some functions to read data and create ts files
Folder inputs: original files for differents scenarios (files for 4 species created by Sarah)   
Folder inputs --> initial run: OM used to create the simulations 
Folder sims: nsim ts.dat files 
Folder sims--> rep nsim .rep files (outputs with the simulated data)
Folder sims--> par nsim .par files (outputs with the simulated data)
